# Clustering-algorithm-to-find-roommates.
Data collection, EDA, preprocessing, PCA and unsupervised machine learning models. Clustering methods, such as k-means, GMM, and DBSCAN, were tested, along with their corresponding statistical measures to evaluate model effectiveness (Silhouette Index, Elbow Method, and 2D representation of clusters in a scatter plot)
